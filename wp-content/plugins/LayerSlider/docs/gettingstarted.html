<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>
	We understands that getting started with LayerSlider WP can be tough for some users,
	so we created a video which helps you understand the basic concept of how the plugin
	works. It mostly aims animations, this is the tricky part for most of our costumers.
	<br><br>

	Before you watch this video, we reccomend you to read the rest of this documentation
	to have a feeling about how things works, some familiarity with the settings and the
	interface can be a good point and it helps you to fill the gaps for things isn't in
	the video.

	Please note that this video is available in Full HD, so in fullscreen mode you can
	see our settings fields and their values.
