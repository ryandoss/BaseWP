<h3>Positioning sublayers</h3>

	Just grab a sublayer and move it around in the editor to set your desired position.
	For accurate positions, you can set the left and top values manually
	under the style tab of the sublayer. If you want to use percentage values you should set them manually in the sublayer options.

	If you want to see your layers and sublayer in action, you can click on the
	"Enter Preview" button. This will embed a full-featured LayerSlider, just like
