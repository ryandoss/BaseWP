<h3>Inserting the slider with shortcode</h3>
<p>
	You can place your sliders into pages and posts with their shortcodes.
	You can find the shortcode for each slider in this page next to their names
	in the list view. To insert the slider, edit a page or post and insert its
	shortcode into the WordPress text editor.
</p>

<h3>Inserting the slider with the LayerSlider WP widget</h3>
<p>
	LayerSlider WP supports widgets, so you can place your slider in your
	front-end page just by a drag n' drop. To do that, navigate to the Appearance
	menu on your left sidebar and select "Widgets". Grab the LayerSlider WP
	Widget and drop it into one of your widget area. <br><br>

	Please note that some themes may not support a widget area what you need.
	In this case, you can create a new widget area by editing your theme files.
	<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Widgetizing_Themes" target="_blank">Here</a>
	is the official documentation about widgetizing your theme.
</p>

<h3>Calling the slider from your theme files</h3>
<p>
	If you want to hardcode the slider into your theme files, you can use
	the shortcode for that. There is no any special function to call, WordPress
	already supports these kind of things with the "do_shortcode()" function.
	This function waits for a shortcode to its parameter, see the first point of
	this section to where you can find the right shortcode.

	<br><br>
	Example: &lt;?php echo do_shortcode('[layerslider id=&quot;1&quot;]'); ?&gt;
</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>
	Your sublayers are not animating properly just sliding in without any effects? Did you use the shortcode to put the slider on your page?
	If the answer is yes, please go to the page or post editor and in the WP Text Editor click on the HTML view upper right corner of the editor box.
	Please check if the shortcode is inside a CODE element or not. If yes, please remove the opening and closing tag of that CODE element and save your page or post.
